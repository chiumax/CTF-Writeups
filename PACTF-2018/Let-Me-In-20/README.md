**Hint:**
>Something tells me the user might not be using complex passwords…

## Solve
The hint tells me that it's probably a really common password. I searched up [common passwords](https://www.google.com/search?q=common+passwords&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS732US732&oq=common+passwords&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3896j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

pass: `123456`

**Flag:** `rgSueiMYehWJSZPZr`
