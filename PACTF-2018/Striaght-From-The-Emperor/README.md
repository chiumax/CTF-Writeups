# Straight From The Emperor
**Points:** 
**Description:**
>The Emperor says ny_nx_tsq3_zumnqq_kwtr_mjwj_6acd98ea55–what could it possibly mean? 
I hear that he ‘encrypts’ numbers now too, something about appending them to the alphabet…

**Hint:**
>Some say he’s an emperor, I say he’s a salad.

## Solve
Not sure what the hint is supposed to mean, but the first cipher I tried is the Caesar Cipher.

Make sure you append numbers to the alphabet set.
