# Just No
**Category:** Binary Exploitation **Points:** 40 

**Description:**
>A program at /problems/276fc27f3ef921f0e2f0f75ba95c9e60 has access to a flag but refuses to share it. Can you convince it otherwise?

**Hint:**
>Check out the difference between relative and absolute paths and see if you can figure out how to use them to solve this challenge. Could you possibly spoof another auth file it looks at instead...?

## Solve
Navigating to the problem directory presents us with this:

```
dumblole@shell-web:/problems/276fc27f3ef921f0e2f0f75ba95c9e60$ ls -la                              
total 64                                                                                           
drwxr-xr-x   2 root       root       4096 Mar 31  2017 .
drwxr-x--x 573 root       root      36864 Apr 16  2017 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 hacksports just-no_7     2 Mar 31  2017 auth                                        
-r--r-----   1 hacksports just-no_7    33 Mar 31  2017 flag                                        
-rwxr-sr-x   1 hacksports just-no_7  7800 Mar 31  2017 justno
-rw-r--r--   1 hacksports just-no_7   838 Mar 31  2017 justno.c    
```
We can't open either `auth` or `flag`, but we can take a look at `justno` and `justno.c`

Running `justno` tells us that `auth` says no.

```
dumblole@shell-web:/problems/276fc27f3ef921f0e2f0f75ba95c9e60$ ./justno                            
auth file says no. So no. Just... no.
```
`justno.c` contains the source code. I've uploaded the file to this GitHub

Looking at the first couple lines of the `main` function shows us that the function uses relative paths.

```
FILE* authf = fopen("../../problems/276fc27f3ef921f0e2f0f75ba95c9e60/auth","r")
```
