# Very Small Primes

**Description:**
>During their algebraic geometry class, Pawel and Keith had a conversation. A short transcript of the conversation is given below:

>Keith: "Pawel, I want to send you a message."

>Pawel: "Ok".

>To receive Keith's message, Pawel asks his cousins Simone and Simtwo to give him two primes p, q. Pawel then writes his public key (N, e) on the blackboard in the front of the class (where N = pq). Keith then promptly writes the number C on the blackboard. Pawel gives a thumbs up, signifying that he received the message. 

>Craig saw the first exchange between Keith and Pawel and he wants to know what Keith's message is. Luckily, Craig knows that Simone can only give numbers with at most 6 digits (when written in base 10) and he was able to find the message.

>N = 0x10722aa034ca559f3e30fdd3a5fbdbb6f2eede584f4aedc764f0bf8a72bc7853ccc874e975563fa80348cbd3355e36903e5cbbc4ce7ba91ca29989b8a09fe3212931e4421a3460501c91aa2b47729eb114c22f15d87d11deddd102f576704dd8ae8aca12afad9e0fbf909f7be534ff73fc17d2ef11ac76b2eaa9a62b7ffc0bd
