# CTF-Writeups :checkered_flag:
A collection of writeups to some of the CTFs I've participated in. These writeups are in my opinion a little bit too in depth, but the purpose of this is to show my thought process while completing challenges.

## Why do I write writeups?  👏
* Helps me better understand what I did since I have to explain the process
* Just for fun
* I hope these writeups can help others - Just trying to be the person I needed when I was a noob (Still am)
